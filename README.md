### About me
I'm an Engineer and I have 1 year experience in academic research.

I have been a part of the EDUCATIONAL TUTORIAL PROGRAM (PET) AUTONET/MEC, where I have also worked as a leader of the group, and I've developed some researches, as a production of a low-cost drone using a 3D printer, for example.

Nowadays, I am in the last year of Mechatronics Engineering, where I am looking for a job in any other area alike. I've already been part of some researches groups where I was able to project power plants, which was very important to build my knowledge in the area that I do well.

During my free time I study subjects related to electric and control projects development.
